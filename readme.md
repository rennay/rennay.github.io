Hi there, I'm Rennay Dorasamy!

The intention of this site is (in order of priority):
1. document what I have done over the last few months
2. "bootstrap" *me* in the event that I have to stop a project and return to it after a period of time
3. bootstrap *other users* to get up and running faster

The image below details my areas/technologies of interest which are detailed in my posts/articles.
